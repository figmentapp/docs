# Out

The Out node indicates what should come _out_ of your network, so the Out node should be the the last node in your network.

- When using fullscreen mode, it will take the output of the out node.

In the Out node you can enable the "stats" option. This allows you to monitor the framerate of a running project.

The Out node is created by default in a new project so there's probably no need to create one (having more than one Out node doesn't make sense and is probably confusing).
