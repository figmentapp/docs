# Welcome to Figment

Figment is a **modular, node-based app for creative AI**. It fills the gap between pre-built large language and image models and code-heavy machine-learning frameworks, giving artists and researchers a visual environment to:

- Load and curate datasets
- Augment and transform images, video or sensor data
- Train or fine-tune models
- Run real-time inference and route the results to other creative software via OSC, MIDI or WebSockets

Every node is GPU-accelerated, so you can iterate at the speed of thought and deploy your pipelines in demanding contexts like live performances and long-running installations.
