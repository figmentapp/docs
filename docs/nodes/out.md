# Out

The Out node indicates what should come _out_ of your network, so the Out node should be the the last node in your network.

- When using fullscreen mode, it will take the output of the out node.
- When using [export](/export), the out node is selected by default (although you can select another node).

The Out node doesn't have any parameters. It's created in the default network so there's probably no need to create one (having more than one Out node doesn't make sense and is probably confusing).
